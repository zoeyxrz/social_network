## PJ_Media.RMD 
PJ_Media.RMD is the code file of final project, which is to analyze a sample network containing media (newspaper and TV) channels and users of these channels.
By finishing this project we are able to answer the following questions:
Which are the top 3 most popular channels overall?
How many channels does the average user consume?
Was there a difference in preference based on gender?
Was there a difference in preference based on age?
Did being married affect the preference of channels?
Which gender watches more of the channels in the network on average?
Which age-group watches more of the channels in the network?
Are there any distinct clusters or communities in the network?

## PJ_Cancer_FL.Rmd

PJ_Cancer_FL.Rmd is for project : "INTERCONNECTIVITY OF CANCER COALITIONS". 
Abstract of this project:
Given a network of researchers with 3 different relations among themselves, as well as attributes of researchers, the main challenge of this project is to measure the interconnectivity of 2 groups of researchers (i.e. those that work on cancer and those that work on communicable diseases). Further, since data for 2 years is provided, the change in the interconnectivity over the years can be measured.
