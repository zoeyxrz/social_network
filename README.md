## PJ_Media.RMD 
PJ_Media.RMD is the code file of final project, which is to analyze a sample network containing media (newspaper and TV) channels and users of these channels.
By finishing this project we are able to answer the following questions:
1.      Which are the top 3 most popular channels overall?
2.      How many channels does the average user consume?
3.      Was there a difference in preference based on gender?
4.      Was there a difference in preference based on age?
5.      Did being married affect the preference of channels?
6.     Which gender watches more of the channels in the network on average?
7.     Which age-group watches more of the channels in the network?
8.     Are there any distinct clusters or communities in the network?
